        "In this notebook we are going to implement a Question Answering system leveraging **BERT-SQuAD**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**BERT-SQuAD** is a BERT model fine-tuned for the SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) dataset. SQuAD is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.\n",
        "\n",
        "In layman terms, as we explained in the language modeling session, BERT is a language model that is able to understand English and BERT-SQuAD is the same model, but now fine tuned to know how to answer questions (i.e., learn the nuances related to answering questions, such as focus on the entities of the question to provide the answer). For a more detailed description of the model, please refer to the original Stanford paper: https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/reports/default/15848021.pdf\n",
        "\n",
        "In particular, we are going to apply this model to a scenario that is, sadly, very topical nowadays. To answer questions about the COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19).\n",
        "CORD-19 is a resource of over 200,000 scholarly articles, including over 100,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. For more information, please refer to: https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge\n",
        "\n",
        "Together with the CORD-19 dataset, a groups of tasks (or questions) have been released: https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks. What we are trying to do is to, leveraging the BERT-SQuAD model, \"read\" the 200K articles and answer the questions.\n",
